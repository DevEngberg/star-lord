# Project Title
TBD

## Target Audience

Depends on the type of bot we would want, and what it would do - unsure at this point.

## What Problem Does This Project Solve?
A bot of some sort - Heroku has a feature for this and I recently made one for Discord (voice communication app) - Bobby B Bot. 
Again depends on the type of bot, but we could set it up to really do anything. Send automated emails, messages, etc. Maybe do a cool Iron Man approach and make a personalized Jarvis of some sort? :)   Maybe a to-do bot, similar to the to-do list we built in class, but vastly superior and personalized to the user.
