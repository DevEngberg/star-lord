# Project Title
Starlord (name TBD)

## Target Audience
Nerds, Stargazers, etc.

## What Problem Does This Project Solve?
Could be cool to make an app that integrates NASA API (I know it can't be that difficult to get, and Chris could help - we did it in an example.), and maybe a few additional APIs to pull data on upcoming celestial events - and automate reminders for people, or allow them to select certain events they'd be interested in? Eclipses, etc.
