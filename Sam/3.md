## What Problem Does This Project Solve?
The gaming world is oversaturated with games for every popular genre. Too few gamers explore the classics of the past, or the indie games of the present. This app would take in a user profile, current modern games they enjoy, and suggest either a solid retro hit that is available for purchase online or an indie game.
