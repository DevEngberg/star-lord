# Project Title
A POS system for a store.

This can have a user facing interface, and a manager interface. 

User sees item, price, detail, etc.  Can add to cart (maybe have a countdown for cart to expire?)  
    User clicks order, is shown total cost.

Upon Checkout, the user enters tender, gets change back.  

Manager end:  see inventory, pricing, details, and can change it all.  
    Gets alertes for orders low on stock
    Fills the 'till" with money
