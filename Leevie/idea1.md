# Project Title

Gif App that gets gifs from Giphy, saves them to you online repo (or the links to them, rather), and keeps them so you can use them on any IM platform.  We can incorporate a download button that downloads the actual files from their repo.  

Gifs can have keywords.

App can use more than one source (other than Giphy).

Saves all to a My SQL database. 

## Target Audience

Anyone who collaborates over IM for anything.

## What Problem Does This Project Solve?

Many IM programs come with only default emoticons and gifs.  Some don't allow you to save gifs that you use all of the time.  IE, my job uses Jabber.  It's a PITA to search for a gif everytime I want to use one, or drag and drop from a folder.  If I change computers (or jobs, for that matter), I have to make sure to back up my folder.  This app will eliminate that.
